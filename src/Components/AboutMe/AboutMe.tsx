          After finishing high school I decided to fulfill my dream and become a
          developer. I enrolled in a programming academy and studied full-stack
          web development. I have always loved to solve the problems and
          challenges that are given to me and create solutions for them. I'am
          dedicated and passionate individual who is always ready to learn and
          master new things and skills as well as trying out new technologies
          and self-improvement. Always ready for new things in the world of
          technology. In my free time, I usually work out in the gym and watch
          sports.
